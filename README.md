# quizgame

Project Description
Build a quiz game.
It should be based on your RS research questions. You can set the correct answers yourself and have the user play the quiz while giving them points for any questions they get right. If a user get's all the questions, show them a congratulations message, otherwise, encourage them. Both instances should then allow the user to play again. If you want to add some advanced functionality, shuffle the questions up.

Deliverable: Javascript functionality

    Focus area:

        Make the buttons clickable
        Check if the answer is correct or not
        If it is correct, change the button background colour to green and disable the rest of the buttons
        If the user gets it correct, add 1 point to their score
        If it wrong, change background colour to red, and mark the correct the correct button with a background colour green, then disable the rest of the buttons
        After 2 seconds, go to the next question. There should be at least 10 questions
        After all questions, display the total score and add a button to restart the game
